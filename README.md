# hello-world

Hello there, I am a woman who reperesents strength and resilience. I dare to be fearless and try something new. I need more money and I
want to be able to provide more opportunity for my children as well as myself. I want to eat whatever the hell I want to eat when I want.
I want to be able to have a calamity and have the means to rescue myself from whatever hardships caused when you don't have enough to 
make the payment or to cover the repair costs. I want nice things, I want to look pretty. I don't need to be rich but dammit, I'm worth 
more than $15 an hour.... there should be a comma in the number I'm worth. I could improve my work ethic and  and maybe be on time and 
heighten my confidence.
